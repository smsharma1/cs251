1. (0 marks) Learn make and gnuplot (at least the basics).

2. (30 + 20 marks) Write two articles in latex, one any of the computer science
topics, and the other on any of the general topics. You must use bibtex and
makeindex. Also, generate a table of contents, list of figures and list of
tables.  Also, ensure that the article has sufficient number of table(s),
figure(s), equation(s), theorem(s), list(s), etc.

The computer science topics are:

(a) Suppose you have invented the technique of binary searching. Explain it.
Also, compare it with linear searching. Discuss in detail the pros (faster
querying time, etc.) and cons (pre-processing needed, etc.). Analyze taking
into account the number of queries in addition to the size of the input.

(b) Suppose you have invented the technique of quick sorting. Explain it. Also,
compare it with selection sort. Moreover, as in part (a), do all the necessary
and relevant analyses.

(c) Suppose you have invented the technique of 2's complement binary
arithmetic. Explain it. Also, compare it with 1's complement binary arithmetic.
Moreover, as in part (a), do all the necessary and relevant analyses.

The general topics are:

(a) Suppose you are a fan of Mr. X in sports Y.  Explain why you think he is
the "best" player. Invoke statistics.

(b) Suppose you are making a list of things to do for a new student in IIT
Kanpur. Write a document that lists all the compulsory and optional activities.

(c) Suppose you love history. Choose a significant event in Indian history and
describe it.

Include the two topics as two separate folders with appropriate tex, bib and
pdf files.
