1. (10 marks) Set up PHP with preferably Apache (or Lighthttpd) and SQLite (or
MySQL) in the VM allocated to you.

2. (60 marks) Create a website that conects to the database on courses created
as part of Assignment 8.  Host it as the main webpage of your VM.  (You will
need to host the pages at /var/www/ or some sub0directory of it.)

The website should have at least 3 pages.  The pages should use basic HTML with
external CSS stylesheet(s).

The first is the main page that describes the capabilities of the website.  It
should link to two pages, one each for insertion and querying.

The insert page should have capabilities to insert data for students, faculty
members, courses and enrollments. Take care of any cascading issues.  The input
fields should be taken in the form of POST requests and should be handled by
PHP.

Similarly, develop a querying page with the query statements used in Assignment
8.  It should again use POST requests, etc.

The result pages for insertion and querying should use PHP.

3. (30 marks) Use CSS to stylize the HTML pages and the result pages for the
website.  In particular, use the following capabilities: (1) Use contrasting
styles for odd and even rows of a table. (2) The headings should be differently
styled. (3) Show the exact query (or insertion) run. The query string should
use typewriter-type fonts (e.g., Courier). (4) The input parameters in the
query string such as course number, student roll number, etc. should use
differently colored fonts.

The CSS files should be external.
