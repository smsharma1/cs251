1. (10 marks) Write a bash script that inputs name as string and displays
"Namaskar, <name>" where <name> stands for the name that has been input.  Hint:
Use variables such as $name. Also, look at the special meaning of $1, etc.

Sample input:
script.sh Arnab

Output:
Namaskar, Arnab

2. (15 marks) Given two csv files (comma-separated) having the same number of
lines, write a bash script to create a file called "output.txt".  Each line of
output.txt should contain the first, second and fourth fields of the first file
and the second and third fields of the second file.  You can assume that the
first file will contain at least four fields and the second file will contain
at least three fields.

Sample input:

file1
roll,name,dept,total
001,AB,cse,78
003,XYZ,maths,100

file2
roll,rank,grade
001,23,C
003,1,A*

output.txt:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,AB,78,23,C
003,XYZ,100,1,A*

3. (25 marks) Write a bash script that will read a file of numbers and outputs
the average of them.  You should only use bash functions and not specialised
commands such as sed, awk, etc.

Sample input:
34
25
109
2

Output:
42.5

An output of 42.500, etc. is also correct.
