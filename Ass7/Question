1. (20 marks) Write an octave script to generate three sets of two numbers
each. Each number is the random outcome of the roll of a dice.

The first dice is a fair dice.  The second has a bias of 5% extra for the
higher two numbers, i.e., 5 and 6 happen with probabilities (1/6 + 0.05) each
while the rest are equally likely.  The third dice has a bias of 10% extra.

For example, in one run, the outcome may be:
2 4
5 3
6 5

Now, generate the above set in sizes of 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, and 10^4 respectively.

Store the averages for each throw and each dice over the set sizes in a file.

2. (30 marks) Use the above output files to generate histogram plots in
gnuplot.  The plot should have 4 groups of histograms, each corresponding to
the size.  In each group, there are 3 histogram bars, corresponding to the
dices.  Each bar plots the average of the two throws stacked on top of each
other.  Thus, the entire histogram height shows the sum of the two throws of
the dice.  Label the plot appropriately.

3. (10 marks) Use xfig to generate figures of two dice.

4. (15 marks) Use the above gnuplot and xfig outputs inside a Latex document
that explains why you should get successively higher sums for the later dices.

Include the expected values of the sums for the three dices.

Include the figures at an appropriate scale.

5. (25 marks) Write a makefile to incorporate all the above tasks.  In
particular, it must include the targets for generating octave output, gnuplot
output, xfig output (see the command fig2dev for a command-line option), and
latex output with their dependencies duly resolved.  Also, include a target for
cleaning that erases all the intermediate files, and a heavier cleaning that
erases everything except the source files.
