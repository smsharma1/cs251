1. (10 marks) Write a bash script that uses grep to find if any student has
failed (grade 'F') or if any student has got an A*. Assume that A* grades are
input as '*'. The input file will have the format as shown in the examples. Be
careful since the name may contain blanks and the character 'F'. You may assume
that the name will contain only alphabets, and the roll, total and rank fields
contain only numerals.

Input 1:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
003,F YZ,100,1,*

Output 1:
Yes

Input 2:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
003,F YZ,100,1,A

Output 2:
No

2. (20 marks) Modify the above script to display the number of grades of each
type. You may assume that the grades are A*, A, B, C, D, and F.

Input:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
002,D S,77,24,C
003,F YZ,100,1,*

Output:
*: 1
A: 0
B: 0
C: 2
D: 0
F: 0

3. (30 marks) Use sed on the input files. Only if there is any A* or F (you can
use the first script to determine that), change the A* and A grades to "Good",
B and C to "Average", D to "Poor", and F to "Fail". Change the file in-place,
i.e., do not use sed to output lines that are redirected to either the standard
output or other intermediate file.

Input file1.csv:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
003,F YZ,100,1,*
004,G H,12,112,F

Output file1.csv:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,Average
003,F YZ,100,1,Good
004,G H,12,112,Fail

Input file2.csv:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
003,F YZ,100,1,A

Output file2.csv:
roll,name,total,rank,grade
001,A B,78,23,C
003,F YZ,100,1,A
