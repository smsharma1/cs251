1. (20 marks) Write an octave script that will compute the value of pi using
the circle and square method discussed in class.  Use sample sizes of 10^1,
10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6.  Write the output in a file using octave itself
in the following format:

Output:
10    4.5000
100    3.9900
1000    3.4320
10000    3.1032
100000    3.1432
1000000    3.1416

2. (15 marks) Write an octave script that uses the above script to generate the
estimates of pi and then plots them.  Also, plot the value of pi given natively
by octave.  Ensure that the plots are marked meaningfully with title, axes,
legend, etc.

3. (25 marks) Write an octave script to first generate all 51 integers from 0
to 50 into the vector x. For each such integer in x, compute y =
Gaussian(15,$\sqrt{10.5}$).

Now generate samples of sizes 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6 from the above
distribution. Note that this results in 6 sets of vectors.  Call them as s1,
s1, ..., s6, etc. For each of these vectors, compute the histograms that has 51
bins, and whose bin centers are the points in x.  Call them h1, h1, ..., h6,
etc.

Output all y and h? vectors in a file.

4. (10 marks) Write an octave script to read the file produced in Q3.  Plot the
sampled histograms h? along with y against x values.  Ensure that the plots are
marked meaningfully with title, axes, legend, etc.
